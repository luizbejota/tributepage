                <p>Left-wing of <strong>Santos FC</strong> golden era (1962–1963), his achievements went far high for any other regular footballer in Brazil. The “Vila Belmiro Cannon” scored 405 goals in 750 appearances, winning 11 São Paulo state championships, 6 Brazilian league/cup championships, 2 Libertadores and 2 Intercontinental cups (the player who most won titles wearing Santos FC colors, more than the world-famous <strong>Pelé</strong>). He also won the 1958 and 1962 World Cups with the <strong>Brazilian National Team</strong>.</p>
                <p>He is well-known for his potent kick with his left leg - many of his goals were scored from that magical skill. One of the legends of Brazilian soccer, he also was a coach for many other clubs.</p>
                <p>While many endorse Pelé for being the greatest goalscorer and player with most caps for Santos FC, is a fact that not even Pelé played for only one club, as Pepe did. Even that way, Pepe also claimed that he was “<em>the greatest human goalscorer for Santos FC - Pelé is from Saturn</em>”.</p>
                <p>“<em>During my entire career I received several proposals to leave Santos, specially from spanish teams, since that I have spanish parents and the nickname “Pepe” is very commom in Spain. (…) I was approached by <strong>La Coruña</strong>, <strong>Barcelona</strong>, <strong>Valencia</strong>, <strong>Sevilla</strong>, <strong>AC Milan</strong>, <strong>Corinthians</strong> and <strong>Portuguesa</strong>. I did not sign them for only love for my club. I started and ended my career on Santos, always felt happy and the fans loved me. I had no reason to leave and I could not imagine myself playing with another jersey.</em>”</p>
